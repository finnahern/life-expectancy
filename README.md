[Link to the live project deployed on Heroku](https://life-expectancy-ms3.herokuapp.com/)

A simple Python application which reads a given .csv file containing data such as life expectancy, GPD, infection and immunisation rates for various diseases and other statistics for 167 countries in 2015. The program parses the file and displays the top and bottom five countries in the selected category to the user. Although only one is used the program will in theory work with any .csv file in the correct format.
