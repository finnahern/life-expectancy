11/8/21 - Sort function sorting some categories correctly, but not others.
FIX: list elements in the data variable were all strings. The problem was solved once I converted them into floats before sorting

14/8/21 - Object definition not working properly. "Instance of data_category" has no "get_name/info" member"
